## About

I’m a backend-focused software engineer working on large-scale, production systems.  
I enjoy designing reliable architectures, debugging hard production issues, and turning ambiguous problems into simple, scalable systems.

My interests sit at the intersection of:
- Distributed systems
- Backend & infrastructure engineering
- Data pipelines and stateful services
- Practical AI/ML integration in production systems

I write system design case studies and engineering deep dives to document real-world tradeoffs.
